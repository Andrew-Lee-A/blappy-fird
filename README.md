## Live Server

This was used for testing in the development stage as it create a temporary server displaying the current resorces in our folder, this was needed as Phaser has to be run in a server to be viewed for development.
We used live server through via VScode extension so we can select the file being run on the server by right clicking and selecting 'open with live server' or click the button at the bottom left to automatically run our index.html file.

## Jest

This was used as our testing framework to help ceate test cases for our user stories.
This can be start by running npm test in the terminal or npm test -t <test-file-name> for a specific test file.
